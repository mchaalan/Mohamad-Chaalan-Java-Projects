# MAZE GENERATOR

## Maze is a GUI interface for generating random mazes using various maze generation algorithms such 
## as depth first search and prims algorithm. Future versions of this project will include more 
## maze generation algorithms such as Kruskals algorithm. Future implementations of this project will
## also include a Maze solver and an animation of how the maze is being generated and solved.
