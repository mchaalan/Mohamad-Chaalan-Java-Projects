# MAZE GENERATOR
Maze is a GUI interface for generating random mazes using various maze generation algorithms such as depth first search and prims algorithm. Future versions of this project will include more maze generation algorithms such as Kruskals algorithm. Future implementations of this project will also include a Maze solver and an animation of how the maze is being generated and solved.

# Bugs 
Running the DFS Generator on a 100 X 100 maze may possibly casue a stack overflow error however will eventually work if you click on the button a couple times. Prims Generator works on all Maze sizes.
